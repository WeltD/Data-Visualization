      <h2>Question 1: Analyze the development of cost-of-living over time. Are there any detectable trends?</h2>

      <p>
        The Data is from the <a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/inflationandpriceindices/articles/costofliving/latestinsights">Cost of living lastest insight - Office for National Statistics</a>.
      </p>
      <p class="explanation">
        I aggregated the data and then used pandas to filter it.I kept only inflation data related to the cost of living from 2016 to 2023, and in addition to the generalised CPIH (Consumer Prices Index including owner occupiers' housing costs), I added inflation data for energy (Electricity, Fuel), housing (House, Rental), transportation (Railway), and food inflation.
